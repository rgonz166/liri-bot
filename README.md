# LIRI-bot
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Liri uses the following commands:

*`my-tweets`

*`spotify-this-song`

*`movie-this`

*`do-what-it-says`
